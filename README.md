# After the above command, you can now install all your dependencies as follows: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

# the 'requirements.txt' file at the root of the project directory was generated with this command 'pip freeze > requirements.txt'. When you have installed new dependencies and want to add your code git repo, run the command above to update your requirement.

# run this command 'flask run --reload --debug' to keep your app running while in development mode
